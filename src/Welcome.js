    <p>Welcome to FoodEase - a revolutionary way to find dining options in NYC catered to your tastes.</p>
    <br />
    <p>As a New Yorker, you don't trust strangers that easily. Then why trust them with food reviews? After all, you have no idea what was going on in Bob's head as he left that 5-star review, because you have no idea who Bob is and what his criteria was.</p>
    <br />
    <p>But you know that you see eye-to-eye with your friend Brandon when it comes to food. So follow Brandon on FoodEase, and whoever else you choose, to see only their reviews of New York's restaurants.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Prepare to try out new restaurants more confidently and never be disappointed again!</p>
